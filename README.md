Cnest is a mobile-first, full-stack JavaScript framework built on Fastify, designed to deliver secure and responsive web applications with client-side routing and a modular structure. It combines server-side performance with enhanced client-side experiences, leveraging WebSocket (Socket.IO) for real-time features and Bulma for styling.

Cnest’s Fastify-based server includes middleware for security, such as HTTP parameter pollution (HPP) protection, XSS filtering, and DOMPurify for sanitization. Session management is handled through cookies, enhancing security across client sessions.

On the client side, Cnest offers a seamless routing system that supports dynamic page transitions with error handling. The UI uses animations, opacity effects, and backdrops for smooth, visually engaging experiences. The modular design organizes key functionalities into separate components—like layout rendering, event management, and caching—ensuring maintainability and scalability. 

With email integration and a well-structured database interaction layer, Cnest is ideal for developing secure, interactive applications optimized for mobile responsiveness and performance.
